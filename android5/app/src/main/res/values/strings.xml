  <string name="homepage_faq_action_more">See more FAQs</string>
  <string name="homepage_faq_title_one">What information does Full AdShield keep?</string>
  <string name="homepage_faq_desc_one">Full AdShield does not track or share any of your network activity. If you use Full AdShield Plus, for technical reasons we need to collect the most minimal data required to keep the service operational. Please consult our Privacy Policy available in the top menu for details.</string>
  <string name="homepage_faq_title_two">How is my privacy protected?</string>
  <string name="homepage_faq_desc_two">Full AdShield prevents apps and browsers installed on your device from sending your private data (known as tracking fingerprints) to the Internet. It also encrypts some of your network activity (DNS queries). If you need more protection, Full AdShield Plus makes your device connect through our VPN, and uses the WireGuard® protocol to encrypt your entire network traffic.</string>
  <string name="homepage_faq_title_three">What is Full AdShield Plus?</string>
  <string name="homepage_faq_desc_three">Full AdShield Plus is our safe and modern VPN (Virtual Private Network) service. It uses WireGuard® - a fast protocol with best-in-class encryption and low battery usage. Full AdShield Plus encrypts all of your network activity in real time, giving you the highest level of protection available. You also get the popular VPN features - hide your IP address, change your location, and unblock geo-restricted content.</string>
