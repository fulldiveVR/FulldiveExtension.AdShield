     * source code, and it seems that it should be safe to assume so.
     *
     * This is risky, but the only alternative I could find to identify networks, would require
     * to use SSID in case of WiFis, and that requires the background location permission, which
     * has a terrible UX. User literally has to go to settings to grant it, plus the OS will show
     * a scary notification everytime we actually access the SSID while being in background. I guess
     * only Google apps are cool enough to access the background location without a fuss.
